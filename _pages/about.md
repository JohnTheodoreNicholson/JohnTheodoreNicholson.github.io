I am currently a fourth year PhD student at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario. My research supervisor is [Matt Valeriote](https://math.mcmaster.ca/~matt/). I am interested in the connections between universal algebra and theoretical computer science. My work focuses on applying the tools of universal algebra, namely tame congruence theory, to problems in the theory of formal languages. I am interested in questions surrounding the logical definability of regular tree languages. I am also very interested in the formalization of mathematics, specifically in [LEAN](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4).
