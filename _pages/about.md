I am currently a fourth year PhD student at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario. My research supervisor is [Matt Valeriote](https://math.mcmaster.ca/~matt/). I am interested in the connections between universal algebra and theoretical computer science. I am also very interested in the formalization of mathematics, specifically in [LEAN](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4).
