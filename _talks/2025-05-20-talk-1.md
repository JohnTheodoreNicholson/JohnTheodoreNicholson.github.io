I gave this talk at [BLAST 2025](https://math.colorado.edu/blast/2025/index.html). I spoke about my PhD research exploring an open problem originally posed by Joel VanderWerf. You can find the slides from my talk [here](./nicholson_slides.pdf). 

Below is a photo of me infront of the outdoor chalkboard at the UC Boulder math building.
