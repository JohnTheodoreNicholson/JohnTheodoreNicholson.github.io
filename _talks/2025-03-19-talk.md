I gave this talk for the [*McMaster Casual Math Seminar*](https://sites.google.com/view/casual-math-seminar/home?authuser=0), in the Winter semester of 2025. The goal of this talk was to introduce an undergraduate audience to some of the questions of computability theory, using the [Busy Beaver problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver), as a motivating question.
